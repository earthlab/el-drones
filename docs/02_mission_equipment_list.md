This document is a working equipment checklist for executing an automated UAV flight for forest ecology applications. Major source of information is Megan Cattau's [UASWorkflows repo](https://github.com/mcattau/UASWorkflows) 

##### Home
- iPad charger, just an USB wall outlet (and use same USBC to USB cable as above)
- iPhone charger, just an USB wall outlet (and use same lightning 8-pin to USB cable as above)
- Solar battery charger, just an USB wall outlet (and use same micro-USB to USB cable as above)\
- Charger for remote control and batteries (3 at a time)
- External battery charger - USB wall outlet and micro-USB to USB cable (one included above, so bring a second)
- Computer charger 
- Cable: mini-USB to USB (to connect GPS to computer)
- Cables and charging equipment for UNAVCO GNSS system


##### Equipment needed in the field: 

Drone Kit
- UAS body
- UAS propeller blades x 8 (4 as back-ups)
- UAS remote control
- Extender for rc
- microSD card x 2
- microSD to SD card converter
- Plastic bags for SD cards
- Cable: USBC to USB (for connecting iPad to remote control, to solar and external batteries, and to USB wall outlet for charging)
- Cable: Lightning 8-pin to USB (for connecting iPhone to remote control, to solar and external batteries, and to USB wall outlet for charging)
- Cable: micro-USB to USB (for connecting solar and external batteries to USB wall outlet for charging and for connecting UAS directly to a computer (if transferring data directly from UAS rather than extracting the SD card and reading it; not recommended, but good to have just in case)

Computer Kit
- iPad to operate the mission
- iPhone as a back-up to operate the mission
- Computer to read data onto external HD
- Notebook
- Pen/pencil
- USBC adapter x 2 for external HD and SD card readers
- SD card reader 
- USB for transferring UNAVCO points

Cooler
- Brush for lens
- UAS batteries x 5
- Neck strap
- Solar battery for phone or iPad charging
- External battery for phone or iPad charging
- External HD x 2 to transfer data after each flight, 3TB each
- Vest or waist pack
- All-purpose tool
- GPS for marking GCPs or other boundaries
- Extra GPS batteries (AA) x a bunch
- Umbrella for shading the screen

- Ground control points x >=15
- Pin flags / rebar or other semi-permanent markers for GCP locations

UNAVCO GNSS system equipment for marking GCPs
- Antennae
- Antennae pole
- Receiver
- Controller
- Cord receiver to antennae


##### Field basics
